# takehome
Take home for camino financial

# IMPORTANT
The code that I actually wrote is in wp-content/themes.
Inside the takehome folder is a file called create_db. You must run it before attempting to test this since it will create the necessary database and tables. 

Another important file is connect_sql.php. It contains constants that the php scripts use to connect to the database. It may require some changes depending on how the server is setup.

# FINAL NOTES
Unfortunately, this is not dockerized nor is it hosted somewhere.
