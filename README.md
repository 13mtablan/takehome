# takehome
Take home for camino financial

# IMPORTANT
The code that I actually wrote is in wp-content/themes which consists of two folders: takehome and takemehomesuccess.

Inside the takehome folder is a file called create_db. You must run it before attempting to test this since it will create the necessary database and tables. The other files that I wrote were style.css, script.js, index.php and header.php. 

Another important file is connect_sql.php. It contains constants that the php scripts use to connect to the database. It may require some changes depending on how the server is setup.

# FINAL NOTES
Unfortunately, this is not dockerized nor is it hosted anywhere. Furthermore, the extent of my testing was on localhost and some minimal docker container.
